    "## Text-to-SQL on a biomedical dataset, optimized for low latency on a single-table\n",
    "---\n",
    "We show here how to build a conversational chatbot that is able to extract information from a relational database with a single table. This is a relatively simple example of text-to-SQL, as there are no joins required. We focus here on showing how to optimize latency using the [SQLDatabaseToolkit](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/toolkits/sql_database/) from [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the generic case, SQLDatabaseToolkit uses the ReAct framework to make multiple calls to the LLM: to ask the database what tables it contains, to ask the database for the schema of a subset of those tables, to test a possible SQL query, to run a query, and more. Given that we know the database has only one table we can make fewer calls to the LLM and hence reduce the latency of the overall text-to-SQL process.\n",
